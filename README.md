# "THE SUSHI-WARE LICENSE"

<make.just.on@gmail.com> wrote this file.

As long as you retain this notice you can do whatever you want
with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you think this stuff
is worth it, you can buy me a **sushi üç£** in return.

(This license is based on ["THE BEER-WARE LICENSE" (Revision 42)].
 Thanks a lot, Poul-Henning Kamp ;)

Are you interested? Yeah, let's apply **"THE SUSHI-WARE LICENSE"** to your software!

That's easy :)

Optionally, you can add this badge to your `README.md`: [![SUSHI-WARE LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-SUSHI--WARE%F0%9F%8D%A3-blue.svg)](https://github.com/MakeNowJust/sushi-ware)

### Notice!

If you are seriously considering to add **"THE SUSHI-WARE LICENSE"** to your project, you should consider another license like [MIT] and [Apache-2.0] in the same way. Because this license is not approved by [OSI] and [FSF] unfortunately. I cannot atone for any possible damage.

However, this license is not a joke. I'm welcome to your üç£ present ;)

## FAQ

> Is this license GPL compatible?

I think "yes", but sorry, I'm not a lawyer.

> Why did you make this license? Why sushi üç£?

I was interested in ["THE BEER-WARE LICENSE"], but I am 19 years old! (Japanese law does not permit the drinking of alcohol üç∫ under 20.) I needed a license like "THE BEER-WARE LICENSE" for myself. At that time, I wanted to eat sushi üç£, so I decided to make "THE SUSHI-WARE LICENSE".

["THE BEER-WARE LICENSE"]: https://people.freebsd.org/~phk/

> Anyway, what is sushi üç£?

Sushi is a food consisting of cooked vinegared rice (*shari*) combined with other ingredients (*neta*). It originated in Japan, but is now known all over the world, enough so that it has become an Emoji üç£. See also this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushi).

> It makes sense, but I like spaghetti üçù... Could I modify this license?

**Of course, okay!** This license itself is based on ["THE BEER-WARE LICENSE"].

> Thanks! I'll buy you a sushi üç£ if we meet some day.

Thanks too! I am looking forward to meeting you ;)
